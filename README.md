## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured on your local machine:

- **Node.js:** Version `20.x` or higher.
- **npm:** Version `9.x` or higher (this comes bundled with Node.js 20).
- **Firebase CLI:** Authenticated with your Google account.

It is highly recommended to use a version manager like `nvm` to manage your Node.js versions. You can switch to the correct version by running:
`nvm use 20`

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies from the root directory:**
